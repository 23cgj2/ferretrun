# ferretrun

Codebase disclaimer: This game was made during a course wherein my professor provided wrapping for certain parts of OpenGL. My personal code is written under the file hw.cpp. The wrapping files are included for context.

This project was the final assignment for a Computer Graphics class taken in Fall of 2022. The prompt was open ended: Using the knowledge accrued over the last semester, create some sort of world. I chose to make a game-of-sorts, entitled Ferret Run, in which the player acts as a ferret and runs around a field populated with a number of bouncing balls. In short, the concept was a ball pit for a ferret-sized creature. Simple, but effective, and surprisingly entertaining.

Once the base physics engine was in place, I added in a few slider options for the player to change certain aspects of the balls, such as amount, mass, and size. 

My initial idea was to have the player race the balls down a sloped hill, attempting to reach the bottom first. Due to time constraints within the semester, and at the advice of my professor, the game simplified into its current state. However, in my free time, I still tinker with the code, in order to eventually bring it to the original concept.
